Passphrase v0.1.0 \- Copyright HacKan (https://hackan.net) GNU GPL v3.0+.
.PP
Generates a cryptographically secure passphrase, based on a wordlist, or a
password, and prints it to standard output.
By default, it uses EFF Large Wordlist for passphrases.
Passphrases with less than 5 words are considered insecure. A safe bet is
between 5 and 7 words, plus at least a number.
For passwords, use at least 12 characters, but prefer 16 or more.
.PP
A custom wordlist can be specified by \fB\-i\fR | \fB\-\-input\fR, the format must be:
single column, one word per line. If \fB\-d\fR | \fB\-\-diceware\fR is used, the input
file is treated as a diceware wordlist (two columns).
Optionally, \fB\-o\fR | \fB\-\-output\fR can be used to specify an output file (existing
file is overwritten).
Instead of words and numbers, a password (random string of
printable characters from Python String standard) can be generated by
\fB\-p\fR | \fB\-\-password\fR.
The number of words (or characters for password mode) is 5 by default, but it
can be changed by \fB\-w\fR | \fB\-\-words\fR.
The number of numbers is 0 by default, but it can be changed by
\fB\-n\fR | \fB\-\-numbers\fR. The generated numbers are between 0 and 999999.
The default separator is a blank space, but any character or character
sequence can be specified by \fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-separator\fR.
