Passphrase v1.2.1
by HacKan (https://hackan.net) FOSS under GNU GPL v3.0 or newer
.PP
Generates a cryptographically secure passphrase, based on a wordlist, or a
password, and prints it to standard output.
By default, it uses an embedded EFF Large Wordlist for passphrases.
Passphrases with less than 6 words are considered insecure. A safe bet is
between 6 and 7 words, plus at least a number.
For passwords, use at least 12 characters, but prefer 16 or more, using the
complete characters set.
.PP
Instead of words and numbers, a password (random string of printable
characters from Python String standard) can be generated by
\fB\-p\fR | \fB\-\-password\fR, specifying the length. It uses uppercase, lowercase, digits
and punctuation characters unless otherwise specified.
Also, a UUID v4 string can be generated by \fB\-\-uuid4\fR or a coin can be thrown
with \fB\-\-coin\fR.
A custom wordlist can be specified by \fB\-i\fR | \fB\-\-input\fR, the format must be:
single column, one word per line. If \fB\-d\fR | \fB\-\-diceware\fR is used, the input
file is treated as a diceware wordlist (two columns).
Optionally, \fB\-o\fR | \fB\-\-output\fR can be used to specify an output file (existing
file is overwritten).
The number of words is 6 by default, but it can be changed by \fB\-w\fR | \fB\-\-words\fR.
The number of numbers is 0 by default, but it can be changed by
\fB\-n\fR | \fB\-\-numbers\fR. The generated numbers are between 100000 and 999999.
The default separator is a blank space, but any character or character
sequence can be specified by \fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-separator\fR.
