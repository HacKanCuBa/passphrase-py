passwords

\[-w WORDS\]

\[-n NUMBERS\] \[-s SEPARATOR\] \[-o OUTPUT\] \[-i INPUT\] \[-d\]

Passphrase v0.2.3-1 - Copyright HacKan (https://hackan.net) GNU GPL v3.0+.

Generates a cryptographically secure passphrase, based on a wordlist, or
a password, and prints it to standard output. By default, it uses an
embedded EFF Large Wordlist for passphrases. Passphrases with less than
6 words are considered insecure. A safe bet is between 6 and 7 words,
plus at least a number. For passwords, use at least 8 characters, but
prefer 12 or more.

Instead of words and numbers, a password (random string of printable
characters from Python String standard) can be generated by **-p** |
**--password**, specifying the length. A custom wordlist can be
specified by **-i** | **--input**, the format must be: single column,
one word per line. If **-d** | **--diceware** is used, the input file is
treated as a diceware wordlist (two columns). Optionally, **-o** |
**--output** can be used to specify an output file (existing file is
overwritten). The number of words is 6 by default, but it can be changed
by **-w** | **--words**. The number of numbers is 0 by default, but it
can be changed by **-n** | **--numbers**. The generated numbers are
between 0 and 999999. The default separator is a blank space, but any
character or character sequence can be specified by **-s** |
**--separator**.

**Example output:**

Default parameters: `chalice sheath postcard modular cider`

Words=3, Numbers=2: `depraved widow office 1822 32264`

Password, 20 chars: `sF\#s@B+iR\#ZIL-yUWKPR`

**Optional arguments:**

**-h**, **--help**

show this help message and exit

**--version**

print program version and licensing information and exit

**-q**, **--quiet**

quiet mode, it won’t print anything but error messages (usefull with
**-o** | **--output**)

**-p** \[PASSWORD\], **--password** \[PASSWORD\]

generate a password of specified lenght from all printable characters

**-w** WORDS, **--words** WORDS

specify the amount of words (0 or more)

**-n** NUMBERS, **--numbers** NUMBERS

specify the amount of numbers (0 or more)

**-s** SEPARATOR, **--separator** SEPARATOR

specify a separator character (space by default)

**-o** OUTPUT, **--output** OUTPUT

specify an output file (existing file is overwritten)

**-i** INPUT, **--input** INPUT
