Passphrase v0.1.0 - Copyright HacKan (https://hackan.net) GNU GPL v3.0+.

Generates a cryptographically secure passphrase, based on a wordlist, or
a password, and prints it to standard output. By default, it uses EFF
Large Wordlist for passphrases. Passphrases with less than 5 words are
considered insecure. A safe bet is between 5 and 7 words, plus at least
a number. For passwords, use at least 12 characters, but prefer 16 or
more.

A custom wordlist can be specified by **-i** | **--input**, the format
must be: single column, one word per line. If **-d** | **--diceware** is
used, the input file is treated as a diceware wordlist (two columns).
Optionally, **-o** | **--output** can be used to specify an output file
(existing file is overwritten). Instead of words and numbers, a password
(random string of printable characters from Python String standard) can
be generated by **-p** | **--password**. The number of words (or
characters for password mode) is 5 by default, but it can be changed by
**-w** | **--words**. The number of numbers is 0 by default, but it can
be changed by **-n** | **--numbers**. The generated numbers are between
0 and 999999. The default separator is a blank space, but any character
or character sequence can be specified by **-s** | **--separator**.
